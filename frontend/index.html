Lord Shiva replied, 'O powerful one. I will give to thee that favourite weapon of mine called the Pasupatha. O son of Pandu, thou art capable of holding, hurling, and withdrawing it. Neither the chief himself of the gods, nor Yama, nor the king of the Yaksha’s, nor Varuna, nor Vayu, know it. How could men know anything of it? But, O son of Pritha, this weapon should not be hurled without adequate cause; for if hurled at any foe of little might it may destroy the whole universe. In the three worlds with all their mobile and immobile creatures, there is none who is incapable of being slain by this weapon. And it may be hurled by the mind, by the eye, by words, and by the bow.'" [VanaParva Chapter 60]
It is personal weapon of Pasupati. So it is always with him.
Pasupathastra is different from pasupatha mantra or pasupatham,
Pasupathastra comes under danurvidya it is an “Astra” and it can able to destroy whole Universe and it must not be hurled on mortals.
The pasupatha mantra or pasupatham is the mantra which is very powerful and can impress the lord Shiva easily . The Pasupata Mantra is one of the most complex and directly fruitful forms of Shiva worship. Arjuna was got this Pasupata Mantra system by Krishna in earlier times. Arjuna thus obtained Pashupatastra, which is the seed of evil.
Pashupatam should be done through Rudra Samputi. With the 169 mantras in Rudram, we should compile the mantra chanting with anoint Lord Shiva.The process of pasupatha prayogam or puja is entirely different from other puja’s.
The devotee has to take diksha for 11 days or 21 days or 41 days
The vrata diksha niyama can be instructed by guru ji
